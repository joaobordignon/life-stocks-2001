# 🖥️ Life Stock 2001

Welcome to **Life Stock 2001**!  
This project reimagines the world where classic 90s computers (think Windows 3.11!) meet ultra-fast modern AI, playful simulation, and a dose of retro-futurism.

## 🎮 Project Overview

Life Stock 2001 is a desktop simulation game written in Python.  
- You play as an entry-level employee, using a vintage terminal to solve quirky challenges, develop skills, manage expenses, invest, and navigate the crazy world of office politics and emerging tech!  
- The codebase is organized for easy learning: experiment in the Jupyter notebook, develop features in Python scripts, and get ready for an installable experience.
