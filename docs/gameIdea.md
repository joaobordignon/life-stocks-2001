# Life Stock 2001: Game Design Document Draft

## Main Idea
**Life Stock 2001** is a retro-futurist simulation game set in an alternate timeline where modern AI, super-fast internet, and advanced technology exist alongside classic late 80s/early 90s user interfaces. The player's entire experience takes place at a pixelated Windows 3.11 terminal, blending nostalgia with high-concept sci-fi elements. Players start as entry-level employees, solve daily challenges, build skills, and manage life assets—all through chunky GUIs and old-school software.

## Core Mood & Setting
- **Aesthetic:** Early internet/PC nostalgia (Windows 3.11, DOS), pixel graphics and low-res icons
- **Technology:** Modern AI assistants, futuristic consumables, and hyper-fast internet baked into a retro interface
- **Atmosphere:** Playful, quirky, and immersive; mixes old-school charm with imaginative "what-if" leaps in tech

## Game Mechanics (Blocks)

### 1. Terminal-Only Game World
- Players interact solely through their computer terminal/desktop interface
- All actions and feedback presented via retro software, pixel icons, and text windows

### 2. Career and Challenge Progression
- Game is divided into **levels**; each level presents a pool of semi-randomized, tailored daily challenges
- Challenges become more complex and interconnected as levels increase
- Solving tasks earns skill points; skills unlock promotions, new job offers, or entrepreneurial opportunities

### 3. Skills & Jobs
- Track skills via Skill Card dashboard
- Skills open paths to promotions, internal job changes, external offers, and start-up partnerships
- Headhunters and NPCs may contact player based on skill/achievement

### 4. Life Sim: Economy & Assets
- Manage **Expenses** (food, rent, bills) through an Expense Manager app
- Acquire/manage **Assets**: houses, investments
- Buy/sell **Consumables** (smart glasses, smart watches, hype gadgets)—each with boosts, some more/less useful or seasonal
- Track financial status through GUI dashboards

### 5. Markets & Marketplace
- Access an in-game **Stock Market** with fluctuating ticker prices (can buy/sell)
- Participate in a "Buy/Sell Exchange"—like a retro Facebook Marketplace
- Trade items and assets with AI-driven "players" or NPCs

### 6. Credit & Debt System
- Player can accrue credit and debt, impacting opportunities and challenges
- Banking tools track score, payments, and consequences for poor financial decisions

### 7. Boot Sequence & Interface
- Authentic boot-up sequence (BIOS prompts, DOS commands)
- Type 'run os' to launch GUI each session
- All core apps shown as pixel icons, navigable pop-up windows, and dialog boxes

## Next Steps (Blocks)
- Clarify level/challenge pool logic
- Main game loop & progression (planned as first Python module)
- Terminal GUI framework (module two)
- Expand skill development and promotions system
- Add stock market simulation logic
- Build asset tracking and marketplace features
- Integrate consumable economy and seasonal gadgets
- Flesh out career branching, failure/success outcomes
- Continue adding blocks as features are defined
