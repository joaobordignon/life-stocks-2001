    - [ ] Write pseudocode and map game flow
    - [ ] Iterate and update with new ideas

- [ ] Prototype the Game Loop (Python Basics)
    - [ ] Print boot sequence and welcome message
    - [ ] Present initial challenge/task (‚ÄúReply to onboarding email‚Äù)
    - [ ] Use input() for actions, advance to next ‚Äúday‚Äù

- [ ] Level & Challenge System
    - [ ] List Level 1 challenges
    - [ ] Randomly present a challenge per turn
    - [ ] Track skills, money, assets with variables

- [ ] Skill Tracker & State Management
    - [ ] Implement skill progression

- [ ] Main Game Script (`main.py`)
    - [ ] Migrate features from notebook to Python scripts
    - [ ] Organize logic into functions/classes

- [ ] Testing & Documentation
    - [ ] Document scripts and functions
    - [ ] Track bugs, notes, and ideas in docs/notebook

# üö© Where to Start?
- [ ] Make a simple game loop (print, input, repeat) in your notebook
- [ ] Expand to randomized challenges, state tracking, and skills
- [ ] Refactor and level-up step by step as you gain new Python/GUI skills!
